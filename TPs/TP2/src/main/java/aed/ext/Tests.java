// Basic Tests

//     Initialization: Tests system startup with multiple users
//     Single Transaction: Tests basic transaction processing
//     Multiple Transactions: Tests handling of several transactions in one block
//     Creation Transaction: Tests special transactions with ID 0 (creation transactions)

// Complex Tests

//     Hacking Functionality: Tests the hackearTx() method and balance reversal
//     Multiple Blocks: Tests adding several blocks sequentially
//     Balance Consistency: Verifies user balances remain consistent after operations

// Efficiency Tests

//     Large Number of Users: Tests with 10,000 users and 1,000 transactions
//     Large Number of Transactions: Tests with 100 users and 5,000 transactions
//     Multiple Hacks: Tests performance of repeated hacking operations

// Edge Cases

//     Empty Block: Tests handling of blocks with no transactions
//     Single User: Tests system with only one user
//     Same Amount Transactions: Tests transaction ordering when amounts are equal
//     Only Creation Transactions: Tests blocks containing only creation transactions

// Key Features Tested

//     Heap Operations: Tests that max-heap maintains correct ordering
//     Handle Management: Verifies handles correctly track positions
//     Balance Updates: Ensures user balances update correctly
//     Transaction Prioritization: Tests highest-value transaction retrieval
//     Average Calculations: Verifies correct exclusion of creation transactions
//     Performance: Measures execution time for large datasets
